## Lessons
- Used Tesseract.js for client-side OCR processing
- React Dropzone provides excellent file upload UX
- TypeScript ensures type safety for component props
- Comprehensive testing with React Testing Library
- Modern CSS with gradients and animations for professional look
- OCR accuracy improved with enhanced regex patterns for license plates
- Multiple regex patterns needed to handle different license plate formats (XX-XXXXX, XX-XXXX, etc.)
- Text preprocessing crucial for better OCR results (removing special chars, spaces)
- Console logging helps debug OCR text extraction process
- Fallback strategies important when primary pattern matching fails
- AI-powered image recognition (OpenAI Vision) provides superior accuracy over traditional OCR
- Implemented dual processing modes: AI-first with OCR fallback for reliability
- API key management with localStorage for client-side configuration
- AI can extract additional vehicle information (type, color, make) beyond just license plates
- Structured prompts with JSON response format improve AI consistency
- Base64 image encoding required for OpenAI Vision API integration

### NEW LESSONS (Plate Recognition Accuracy Fixes):
- **Alphanumeric Plate Support**: Updated regex patterns to handle letters, numbers, and special characters (22‚Ä¢24869 format)
- **Model Migration**: Migrated from deprecated gpt-4-vision-preview to gpt-4o-mini for better performance and cost
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Detailed prompts with specific instructions improve AI accuracy significantly
- **Image URL Handling**: Frontend must use service methods for consistent image URL generation
- **Plate Validation**: Flexible validation patterns needed for international license plate formats
- **Debugging Logging**: Comprehensive logging essential for troubleshooting AI vision responses
- **Character Normalization**: Convert various dash/bullet types to standard characters for consistency
- **Testing Private Methods**: Jest mocking required for testing services with external dependencies

### LATEST LESSONS (Single Car Detection Optimization):
- **Single Car Focus**: Prompting ChatGPT to return only the clearest car improves quality significantly
- **Plate Format Preservation**: Keeping original format with dashes (21-83168) maintains readability
- **Database Constraint Handling**: Unique detection IDs prevent duplicate entry errors
- **Demo Mode Integration**: Saving demo results to database makes system functional during API issues
- **Validation Flexibility**: Allowing letters, numbers, and dashes in plates supports international formats
- **Quality Over Quantity**: One clear detection is better than multiple unclear ones
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specific instructions like "ONLY return the single car" improve AI compliance
- **Error Handling**: Unique identifiers with timestamps prevent database conflicts
- **User Experience**: Dashboard shows results immediately when cars are saved to database

### CRITICAL LESSONS (Runtime Error Fixes):
- **Type Safety**: Always check data types before using string methods like `.includes()` on potentially numeric fields
- **Car ID Field**: `car.id` is a number (database primary key), not a string - convert with `String(car.id)` if needed
- **Detection ID Field**: Use `car.detectionId` (string) for tracking detection methods and demo mode, not `car.id`
- **Defensive Programming**: Use optional chaining (`?.`) and type conversion to prevent runtime errors
- **Demo Mode Detection**: Check `detectionId?.includes('demo')` first, then fallback to `String(id).includes('demo')`

### DATABASE SCHEMA SYNC LESSONS:
- **Schema Mismatch**: Error "Unknown column 'image_path' in 'field list'" indicates database table missing columns defined in Sequelize model
- **Sequelize Underscored**: With `underscored: true`, camelCase fields like `imagePath` become `image_path` in database
- **Force Sync Warning**: `sequelize.sync({ force: true })` recreates tables and **DELETES ALL DATA** - use only for development
- **Safe Schema Updates**: Use `sequelize.sync({ alter: true })` to add new columns without losing existing data
- **Model-Database Sync**: When adding new fields to models (imagePath, confidence, cameraInfo), database must be updated to match
- **Development vs Production**: Force sync acceptable in development, but use migrations in production environments

### IMAGE LOADING & CSP LESSONS:
- **Cross-Origin Images**: Frontend (port 3003) loading images from backend (port 3001) requires proper CSP configuration
- **CSP img-src Policy**: Must include both frontend and backend URLs: `img-src 'self' data: http://localhost:3001 http://localhost:3003`
- **Helmet Configuration**: Default helmet() applies strict CSP that blocks cross-origin images - customize CSP directives
- **Static File Serving**: Express static middleware serves files correctly, but CSP can block frontend access
- **Image URL Construction**: carApiService.getImageUrl() correctly constructs URLs as `http://localhost:3001/uploads/path`
- **Browser Cache**: After CSP fixes, may need to refresh browser cache to see images load properly
- **Debugging Strategy**: Add onError and onLoad handlers to img elements with console logging for troubleshooting
- **Error Fallbacks**: Use base64 SVG fallbacks when images fail to load to provide better user experience
- **Console Inspection**: Check browser developer tools Network tab and Console for image loading failures

### AI ACCURACY LESSONS (Plate Number Recognition):
- **Character Confusion**: AI models can confuse similar-looking characters (1 vs 7, 2 vs 8, 0 vs O) leading to completely wrong plate numbers
- **Prompt Engineering Critical**: Vague prompts like "extract exactly as shown" are insufficient - need ultra-specific character recognition instructions
- **Temperature Setting**: Use 0.0 temperature for maximum accuracy and consistency in character recognition tasks
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Breaking down the recognition process into systematic steps improves accuracy significantly
- **Character-by-Character Reading**: Instructing AI to read each character individually prevents pattern-based errors
- **Self-Verification**: Adding "double-check your reading" instructions in prompts helps catch errors
- **Confidence Requirements**: Better to return no result than a wrong result - set high confidence thresholds
- **Similar Character Mapping**: Explicitly list confusing character pairs in prompts (1/7/I/l, 2/8/B, 0/O/Q, 5/S, 6/G)
- **Format Preservation**: Maintain original formatting (dashes, bullets) while ensuring character accuracy
- **Real-World Testing**: Always test AI changes with actual problematic images to verify improvements
