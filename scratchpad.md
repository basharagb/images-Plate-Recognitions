## Current Task: ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTING ENHANCED AI VISION MODEL SPECIFICATIONS

**Objective:** Implement comprehensive AI Vision model with strict detection criteria and enhanced vehicle analysis.

**ðŸ“‹ NEW VISION MODEL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Strict Vehicle Detection**: Only fully visible and closed cars in frame
2. **Plate Readability Filter**: Extract plates ONLY if clear and readable
3. **Enhanced Vehicle Analysis**: Detect car color and type (Sedan, SUV, Pickup, Truck, Bus)
4. **Plate Format Normalization**: Digits/letters only, replace dots/bullets with "-"
5. **Content Filtering**: Exclude timestamps, text overlays, non-plate numbers
6. **Structured JSON Output**: Standardized response format

**ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**
- [x] Update AI vision prompts with strict detection criteria
- [x] Implement vehicle type classification
- [x] Add plate format normalization logic
- [x] Enhance filtering for blurry/cropped vehicles
- [x] Update response format to structured JSON array
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Update Car model with detectionId field
- [x] Add new API routes for strict vision service
- [ ] Test with various image scenarios (in progress)

**Previous Task Status: âœ… COMPLETED**
- Fixed plate recognition accuracy issues

## Lessons
- Used Tesseract.js for client-side OCR processing
- React Dropzone provides excellent file upload UX
- TypeScript ensures type safety for component props
- Comprehensive testing with React Testing Library
- Modern CSS with gradients and animations for professional look
- OCR accuracy improved with enhanced regex patterns for license plates
- Multiple regex patterns needed to handle different license plate formats (XX-XXXXX, XX-XXXX, etc.)
- Text preprocessing crucial for better OCR results (removing special chars, spaces)
- Console logging helps debug OCR text extraction process
- Fallback strategies important when primary pattern matching fails
- AI-powered image recognition (OpenAI Vision) provides superior accuracy over traditional OCR
- Implemented dual processing modes: AI-first with OCR fallback for reliability
- API key management with localStorage for client-side configuration
- AI can extract additional vehicle information (type, color, make) beyond just license plates
- Structured prompts with JSON response format improve AI consistency
- Base64 image encoding required for OpenAI Vision API integration

### NEW LESSONS (Plate Recognition Accuracy Fixes):
- **Alphanumeric Plate Support**: Updated regex patterns to handle letters, numbers, and special characters (22â€¢24869 format)
- **Model Migration**: Migrated from deprecated gpt-4-vision-preview to gpt-4o-mini for better performance and cost
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Detailed prompts with specific instructions improve AI accuracy significantly
- **Image URL Handling**: Frontend must use service methods for consistent image URL generation
- **Plate Validation**: Flexible validation patterns needed for international license plate formats
- **Debugging Logging**: Comprehensive logging essential for troubleshooting AI vision responses
- **Character Normalization**: Convert various dash/bullet types to standard characters for consistency
- **Testing Private Methods**: Jest mocking required for testing services with external dependencies

### LATEST LESSONS (Strict AI Vision Implementation):
- **Strict Detection Criteria**: Implementing strict filtering dramatically improves detection quality
- **Plate Format Normalization**: Standardizing plate formats (dots/bullets to dashes) ensures consistency
- **Vehicle Type Classification**: Limited vocabulary (Sedan, SUV, Pickup, Truck, Bus) improves accuracy
- **Content Filtering**: Excluding timestamps, overlays, and non-plate text prevents false positives
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Strict mode trades detection quantity for higher quality results
- **Database Schema Evolution**: Adding detectionId field enables tracking different detection methods
- **API Versioning**: Separate endpoints for different detection modes allow A/B testing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests with mocked dependencies ensure service reliability
- **TypeScript Validation**: Strong typing catches errors early in development process
